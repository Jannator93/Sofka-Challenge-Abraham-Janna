# Sofka-Challenge-Abraham-Janna
Quiz game made for Sofka training application.
Question Answer Game

This program, written using JavaScript, HTML and CSS means to be a simple to use yet estable and functional quiz game.
It uses HTML elements to create the UI, takes user inputs, compare them within the code and stores the results of every game session.
While the JavaScript code is far from optimized at the current state of this project, it's completely functional and free of bugs as long as it has been tested.

Notes on every function can be found within the Javascript code as comments.
